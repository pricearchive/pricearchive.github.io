<strong>The question is as follows. How do charts with the history of price changes help to buy cheaper on Aliexpress?</strong>
<br>
<br>It's important to understand the following. There are over 330,000 sellers on Aliexpress (mid 2021). They post over 160 million items for sale. 
<ul>
<li>1. With such a gigantic number of sellers and products, there will always be those who want to sell at a discount. And there will always be those who make a fake discount in hopes of a marketing effect. Only the history of price changes helps us understand whether a discount is real or not.</li>
<li>2. Price history charts show very well how often the price changes. You can see how much it goes up or down and how often it happens. This way you can easily understand what is the best price to buy at. You can easily predict whether the price will fall in the near future.</li>
<li>3. On Pricearchive you can set up an alert form. You'll get an email as soon as the price drops to the desired price or lower. This way you will never miss a sudden discount.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br><strong>Quality graphs with the history of price changes for Aliexpress items</strong>
<br>
<ul>
<li>1. Price history charts need to be of high quality. What does it mean? You need to pay attention to the number of points on the chart. The fact is that some services do not track a price every day, but only several times a month. They connect the dots on the chart and it seems that the price was tracked every day but it is not. Be careful!</li>
<li>2. It is also worth paying attention to for what period of time you can see the data on the price chart. Many services show the chart only the last 3 months, some show the price charts only the last 6 months, only a few represent the history of price changes over the past year. And only Pricearchive has and shows data from 2016.</li>
</ul>
<br><strong>Why do you need a big history of price changes on the chart?</strong>
<br>
<ul>
<li>1. If you need to do research on how prices of some products, such as video cards or processors, have changed over the last 5 years, only Pricearchive charts can help you.</li>
<li>2. If you see a chart with data from the last 2 years, you can see during which sale last year the discount was higher and the price lower. This can help with deciding on an expensive purchase. The savings can be substantial.</li>
